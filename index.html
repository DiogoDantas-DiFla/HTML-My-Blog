   <h2 id="overview"><u>Overview</u></h2>

   <p>There are several simple things in life that bring us great sensations. A good caress on the head at the end of a tiring day, a hug on lonely days, having a good laugh with friends and even walking barefoot in nature.</p>

   <p>Walking barefoot through on any natural surface, like grass, soil or sand, in fact, has health benefits that extend far beyond the pleasurable sensation it offers to your sense of touch. </p>

   <p>Ever wonder why this happens? Recent studies have explained why.</p>

   <p>Studies have shown that walking with your feet, directly touching the soil, allows your body to absorb negative electrons through the Earth, which helps to stabilize daily cortisol rhythm and create a balanced internal bioelectrical environment.</p>

   <p>This energy can nourish your body, mind, and soul.</p>

   <p>Known as "earthing", or "grounding", barefoot walking in nature means ditching your shoes and socks and walking on any natural surface.</p>

   <h1><u>7 reasons to try walking barefoot in nature</u></h1>

   <h2 id="reason1">1) Re-connect with <i>nature</i></h2>
   <p>Going barefoot is one of the easiest ways to become immediately more aware of the natural environment around you. Barefoot walking leads to greater awareness and connection with different terrains, landscapes and animals.</p>

   <h2 id="reason2">2) It controls <i>insomnia</i></h2>
   <p>A study in PubMed revealed that walking barefoot influences physiologic processes as well as induces relaxation. It has also been shown that people who had been exposed to grounding have better sleep at night when compared with those who did not walk barefoot regularly.</p>
   <p>The reason for this is because walking barefoot helps stabilize circadian rhythms, which is the first step to better sleep; as it is the internal system that's designed to regulate feelings of sleepiness and wakefulness over a 24-hour period.</p>

   <h2 id="reason3">3) Reconnect with your <i>inner child</i></h2>
   <p>There may not be any scientific evidence to back this up, but you probably don’t need any to be convinced that walking barefoot in the grass is a great way to step away from your adult self for a moment and get back in touch with your child-like self who once played happily and freely outside without any shoes on. The simple act of walking barefoot can help you open yourself back up to that sense of carefree playfulness, which has a tendency to fade away as we grow older into adulthood and become distracted by all our responsibilities.</p>

   <h2 id="reason4">4) Improves <i>eyesight</i></h2>
   <p>Walking barefoot on grass is an effective way to improve eyesight naturally. There are points under the feet to which the eye nerve system is attached. According to reflexology, applying pressure to those points can energize the eyes. Looking at green also relaxes your eye muscles.</p>
   <small><a href="#backtotop">(Back to top)</a></small>

   <h2 id="reason5">5) Practice <i>mindfulness</i></h2>
   <p>Barefoot walking is a great way to practice mindfulness, as the new sensations you are constantly experiencing through your feet help you to stay in the present moment and conscious of the earth underneath you. Walking in nature, with picturesque landscapes like forests, beaches or mountains to feast your eyes upon, has to be among the settings most conducive to practicing mindfulness and positive thinking.</p>
   <small><a href="#backtotop">(Back to top)</a></small>

   <h2 id="reason6">6) Reduce <i>pain and stress</i></h2>
   <p>In the same study mentioned above, the participants experienced reductions in both pain and stress in addition to improvements in sleep. Insomnia is often associated with a range of problems including physical pain, depression, generalized anxiety and more, suggesting that grounding the body at night can not only improve sleep but also positively impact morning fatigue levels, daytime energy levels and pain levels at night.</p>

   <h2 id="reason7">7) Keeps <i>feet healthy</i></h2>
   <p>When you walk bare feet, the skin of the feet is stretched and kept relaxed. The muscles, ligaments, and tendons in the feet are also strengthened and hence there is no chance of any sore feet. Also, walking barefoot improves the flexor strength which is beneficial for people who have flat feet.</p>

   <p><strong>Note:</strong> Walking barefoot for 15 minutes every day is enough to provide the body with some of the mentioned health benefits. So when you find yourself enjoying the outdoors this spring, make sure you take a moment to kick off your shoes and enjoy going barefoot. It doesn't just feel great — it's super healthy for you, too!</p>
