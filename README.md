# DIO Project Challenge - Create a Web Page using the learned HTML tags

This repository is a "Project Challenge" of the bootcamp "Formação HTML Web Developer" ("HTML Web Developer Training") promoted by the course and bootcamp website called Digital Innovation One (DIO) with the objective of training the students of this bootcamp in order to become Front-End developers. 

The idea of this challenge is to develop a blog, using a very basic structure through HTML tags learned during the practical classes so far.

Blogs are internet pages where there is an article explaining a certain subject.

In this blog prototype, the article is focused on health care and its subject is about the benefits of walking barefoot in nature.
